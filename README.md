# TheTigrayGenocide
A perspective on the current events in East Africa
## What is happening in Ethiopia?
For over a year now, the Ethiopian Tigray ethnic group has been in constant conflict with the Ethiopian government. Innocent women have been raped, children starved, and many left homeless. 
## How is Eritrea involved?
With peace made between Eritrean "President" Isaias Afwerki and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Eritrean soldiers have supported the Ethiopian government in the war with Tigray.
