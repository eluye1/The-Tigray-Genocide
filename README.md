# The Tigray Genocide
A perspective on the current events in East Africa
## What is happening in Ethiopia?
For over a year now, the Ethiopian Tigray ethnic group has been in constant conflict with the Ethiopian government. Innocent women have been raped, the innocent starve, and many have been left homeless.

## How is Eritrea involved?
With peace made between Eritrean "President" Isaias Afwerki and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Eritrean soldiers have been supporting the Ethiopian government in the war with Tigray. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's relationship with Dictator Afwerki proves to be alarming because Ethiopia runs a republic government. Young Eritreans who have no reason to be involved in international affairs have been forced to risk their lives in a war because of their dictator's force. Eritrean refugees (escaping dictatorship) who were in the Tigray region have also been caught in the middle of this Ethiopian civil war.
